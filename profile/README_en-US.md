### ***Remove the limitations of time and space in learning***

## About MDSIG Platform
The MDSIG Sharing Platform provides students of Mingdao High School with a space for discussing various topics. Students can share their thoughts on specific fields on the platform, similar to Facebook or Instagram, and other students can leave comments to engage in discussions.

This platform was developed entirely by a student team, including website design, frontend and backend development, and the required database. All aspects of the platform were set up by the students themselves.

## About SIG and SIG 2.0
In response to the core principles of "spontaneity, interaction, and mutual benefit" of the 12-Year Basic Education Curriculum Guidelines implemented in 2019, Mingdao High School established the SIG Learning Community (Special Interest Group) in the academic year 2020-2021. It encourages students who share common interests in specific fields to form learning groups across departments and grade levels, with guidance from assigned teachers. By the end of the academic year 2021-2022, there were already over 20 SIGs with more than 800 students actively participating. Through student-led sharing, the effectiveness of "teaching is the best way of learning" has been demonstrated.

In October of the academic year 2023-2024, students created the "SIG 2.0 Sharing Platform" to upgrade the SIG Learning Community, eliminating the limitations of time and space. This platform enables community learning by facilitating interactions between students and teachers on cutting-edge trends and current affairs. The platform fosters discussions on social issues and forward-thinking topics such as technology, healthcare, finance management, arts and humanities, and psychology (e.g., AI, quantum computing, world history, renewable energy, addiction psychology). Teachers and alumni mentors are also actively involved. We look forward to your participation in this community of learning and growth.
